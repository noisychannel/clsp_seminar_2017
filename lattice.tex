\slide{Statistical Machine Translation}
\vspace{10mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Given a source sentence $\bf f$, we want to find the most likely translation $\bf e^*$ 
\begin{align*}
e^* & = \argmax_{\bf e} p({\bf e}|{\bf f}) \\
& = \argmax_{\bf e} p({\bf f}|{\bf e}) \; p({\bf e}) && \text{(Bayes Rule)}\\
& = \argmax_{\bf e} \sum_{\bf a} p({\bf f}, {\bf a}|{\bf e}) \; p({\bf e}) && \text{(Marginalize over alignments)}
\end{align*}
\item The alignments ${\bf a}$ are latent. $p({\bf f}, {\bf a}|{\bf e})$ is typically decomposed as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lexical/Phrase \textbf{Translation Model}
\item An \textbf{Alignment/Distortion Model}
\end{itemize}
\item $p({\bf e})$ is the \textbf{Language Model}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\slide{Machine Translation : Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item Decoding may find features besides the ones derived from the generative model useful
\begin{itemize}
\item reordering (distortion) model
\item phrase/word translation model
\item language models
\item word count
\item phrase count
\end{itemize}
\item The use of multiple features typically takes the form of a log-linear model
\maths{\begin{align*} 
p({\bf e}|{\bf f}) = \frac{\sum_i \lambda_i \; f_i}{Z} && (Z \text{ is the partition function})
\end{align*}} 
Where each ``feature'' $f_i$ is exponentially scaled by a weight $\lambda_i$\\
Features are not necessarily valid probabilties
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\slide{Learning to align and translate}
Joint learning of alignment and translation (\textit{Bahdanau et al., 2015})
\begin{itemize}
	\item One model for translation and alignment
	\item Extends the standard RNN encoder-decoder framework for neural network based
			machine translation
	\item Allows the use of an alignment based soft search over the input
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\slide{RNN encoder-decoder}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Encoder} : Given any sequence of vectors $(f_1,\cdots,f_J)$
	\maths{\begin{align*}
		% & h_t = f(x_t, h_{t-1}) && (\text{Hidden state})\\
		& s_j = r(f_j, s_{j-1}) && (\text{Hidden state})\\
		% & c = q(\{h_1,\cdots,h_{T_x}\}) && (\text{The context vector})
		& c = q(\{s_1,\cdots,s_J\}) && (\text{The context vector})
		\end{align*}}
		where $s_j \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the hidden state at time $j$, $c$ is the context
		vector generated from the hidden states and $r$ and $q$ are some non-linear functions. 
	\item \textbf{Decoder} : Predict $e_i$ given $e_1 , \cdots , e_{i-1}$ and the context $c_i$.
	\maths{\begin{align*}
		% & p({\bf y}) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} p(y_t | \{y_1 , \cdots , y_{t-1}\}, c) && (\text{Joint probability})\\
		% & p(y_t | \{y_1 , \cdots , y_{t-1}\}, c) = g(y_{t-1}, s_t, c) && (\text{Conditional probability})
		& p({\bf e}) = \prod_{i=1}^{I} p(e_i | \{e_1 , \cdots , e_{i-1}\}, c_i) && (\text{Joint probability})\\
		& p(e_t | \{e_1 , \cdots , e_{i-1}\}, c_i) = g(e_{i-1}, t_i, c_i) && (\text{Conditional probability})
		\end{align*}}
		where $t_i$ is the hidden state of the RNN and $g$ is some non-linear 
		function that outputs a probability.

\begin{itemize}
\item As more and more parallel data becomes available, the performance of the NMT systems is only going to improve.
\item Research into using monolingual data is already proving successful (TODO: citation here).
\item More complex encoder-decoder models are being proposed every week.
\item Hardware scaling helps supports more parameters and more complex models.

\slide{NMT Challenges : Out of domain}
\begin{itemize}
\item A problem not unique to NMT
\item A fundamental challenge for DARPA Lorelei
\item Assume that you have access to parallel text in the following domains: religious, legal and IT. Your job is to come up with a translation system that can be used to assist and converse with earthquake victims.
\item Possibly worse for NMT because of the drastically different style of writing used in the out of domain training text. This is the trouble with using source conditioned language models.

\slide{NMT Challenges : The UNK problem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item NMT sytems do not copy words from the source into the target if an unknown word is encountered. 	\item For languages which have a large vocabulary size or greater morphological complexity, producing an UNK is safe
	\item Degenerate solution, if enough UNKs are in the training data, safely produce an UNK during translation
\end{itemize}

\item Supervised alignments (\textit{Liu et al., 2016})

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\slide{Adequacy vs. Fluency}
\begin{itemize}
\item SMT systems are tasked with the explicit translation of each component within the source sentence (\textbf{adequate}).
\item NMT systems produce text which is generally fluent and fairly well conditioned on the source sentence (\textbf{fluent}).
\end{itemize}

We plan to combine these benefits by using the SMT system to \textbf{constrain the hypothesis space of adequate translations} available to the NMT system which will choose the most fluent one.

\slide{Re-scoring SMT Search graphs}
\begin{itemize}
\item Search graphs (which can be converted to word lattices) represent a compact and potentially diverse set of translation hypotheses.
\item	In comparison, $n$-best lists may lack this diversity.
\item Search graphs also allow efficient traversal of the hypothesis space, eliminating entire sub-graphs of translations if their prefix scores are bad. This is not possible with $n$-best lists.
\item For this study, we limit the role of the SMT system to constraining the search space. We discard all of the SMT features and scores on the lattice.
\item Out-of-domain neural models are useful again, since they are choosing from a constrained adequate hypothesis space.

\slide{Recombination}
\vspace{10mm}
For lattice re-scoring with stacks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Treat each state in a stack (now, an RNN state) as unique
\item However, only keep the top $k$ entries in a stack when processing it (Histogram pruning)
\item Expand all possibilities from the best $k$ entries of the stack currently being processed.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\slide{Stack-based re-scoring algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Explores an ``adequate'' hypothesis space of translations with neural translation models.
\item The exploration space is typically more diverse than $n$-best lists.
\item No re-training of the models is required.
\item This is faster than using the NMT feature function in SMT systems.
\item When the SMT system is more robust than the NMT models, this may potentially improve quality.

\item Hypothesis : Lattice rescoring's strongest gains may be on language pairs where the domains do not match or we do not have enough training data.
\item Possibly allows the advantage of SMT robustness combined with fluent NMT models, to shine.
